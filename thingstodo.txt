user updating requires password and that is a bit of a problem solve that , maybe remove the password field from there


the top most of the menu bar is still not clickable

check the price column in product , it goes out of range


things to do

- after revising javascript make the validation.js file into a class or an object so we can use it multiple times in a single page
- then apply validation for all forms and select2 for dropdowns
- add datatables to all indexes, maybe make a class for datatables in the future
