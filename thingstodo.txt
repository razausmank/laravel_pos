add a trait that has date mutators

user updating requires password and that is a bit of a problem solve that , maybe remove the password field from there

the top most of the menu bar is still not clickable
check the price column in product , it goes out of range


things to do

- after revising javascript make the validation.js file into a class or an object so we can use it multiple times in a single page
- then apply validation for all forms and select2 for dropdowns
- add datatables to all indexes, maybe make a class for datatables in the future


soft delete doesn't checks for fk integrity so we can potentially delete data that is referenced in some other table
forms are not being submitted without pictures
adding no images on update sets the images to null


question to ask
==================
- why create a remark at all why not just add a field in the database ?
