we can reformat the forms a little more and make them cleaner

language

reformat the login pages structure

add validation to every form

should i have page specific js and include that in every page or just in aap.js


in add new page get all the registered routes and populate it as a dropdown insteal of asking for url or figure something out to solve this

user updating requires password and that is a bit of a problem solve that , maybe remove the password field from there


no of results in pagination , solve it if necessary

the top most of the menu bar is still not clickable
